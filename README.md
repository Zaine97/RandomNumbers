# Development Random Number Generator

## Problem Description

This code solves the problem of generating a random number within a specified range. The problem is commonly encountered when you need to create random values for various applications, such as generating passwords, simulating game mechanics, or conducting statistical experiments.

## Problem-Solving Approach

The code uses Python's built-in `random` module to generate a random number. The `randint()` function from the `random` module is employed to generate a random integer within a specified range.
